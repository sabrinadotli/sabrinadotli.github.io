        		<h1>Hey! My name's Sabrina Li.</h1>
				<p>I love media and I make too many niche playlists that only make sense to me; <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4IUpRMvboBDTWSwkpWyk4e?si=37qDEmZeQ7OhkSWesZ0K6A">here's</a> one for 2am suburban disillusion.</p>
				<p>And <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6U2WjBzq6mC1yFoaTDLPR6?si=hBmfAJYvSOePy_2vQGad-w">here's</a> what I've been playing in the background of Zoom lecture lately.</p>
				<p>I'm interested in creating--whether that means visually, sonically, or textually. Stick around to see what I've done!</p>
				<p>This is my first coding project since failing AP Computer Science in high school. Please be kind.</p>
